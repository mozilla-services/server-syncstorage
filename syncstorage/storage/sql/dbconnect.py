"""
Low-level SQL backend for syncstorage.

This module implements a thin data access layer on top of an SQL database,
providing the primitive operations on which to build a full SyncStorage
backend.  It provides three database tables:

  collections:  the names and ids of all collections in the store
  user_collections:  the per-user metadata associated with each collection
  bso:  the individual BSO items stored in each collection

For efficiency when dealing with large datasets, this module also supports
sharding of the BSO items into multiple tables named "bso0" through "bsoN".
This behaviour is off by default; pass shard=True to enable it.

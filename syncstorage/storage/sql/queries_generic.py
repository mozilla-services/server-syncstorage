Pre-built queries for the SQL storage backend.

This module defines a set of pre-built queries for the SQL storage backend.
Each is either a raw SQL string or a function returning an SQLAlchemy
query object.

In addition to standard bindparam syntax, the query loader supports some
string interpolation variables with special meaning:

    * %(bso)s:   insert the name of the user's sharded BSO storage table
    * %(bui)s:   insert the name of the user's sharded batch_upload_items table
    * %(ids)s:   insert a list of items matching the "ids" query parameter.
